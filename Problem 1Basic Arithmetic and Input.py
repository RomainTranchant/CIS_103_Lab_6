# Problem 1: Basic Arithmetic and Input
# Objective: Practice using basic arithmetic operations and user input.
# Write a Python program that asks the user to enter two numbers. The program should then
# calculate and print the sum, difference, product, and quotient (division result) of the two
# numbers.

# Define the addition function with 2 numbers by returning
# the sum of these 2 numbers
def addition(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2

# Define the subtraction function with 2 numbers by returning
# the difference of these 2 numbers
def subtraction(num1, num2):
    return num1 - num2

# Define the multiplication function with 2 numbers by returning
# the product of these 2 numbers
def multiplication(num1, num2):
    return num1 * num2

# Define the division function with 2 numbers by returning
# the quotient of these 2 numbers, except if the second number
# is equal to 0 because a division by 0 is impossible. It would
# return an error message
def division(num1, num2):
    if num2 != 0:
        return num1 / num2
    else:
        return "Error, division by zero impossible"

# Define the calculator function
def calculator():

# Start a while loop, to allow the calculator to reset itself until
# the user decides to exit, or uses an invalid choice
    while True:

# Prints the choices to the user
        print("Select an operation:")
        print("1. Addition (+)")
        print("2. Subtraction (-)")
        print("3. Multiplication (*)")
        print("4. Division (/)")
        print("5. Exit")

 # Define the variable choice as being the user's input choice
        choice = input("Enter your choice 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5:")

# If the user wants to exit the calculator, print a "Goodbye" message
# and exit the calculator through the break statement
        if choice == "5":
            print("Goodbye!")
            break

# If the user's choice is not between 1 and 5, print an "Invalid choice"
# message and asks the user to restart the calculator and enter a
# valid choice. The break statement stops the while loop
        if choice not in ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]:
            print("Invalid choice! Please restart the calculator"
                  " and enter a valid choice")
            break

# Ask the user to enter the first number, converts the input from a
# string to a float number, and assigns it to the variable num1
        num1 = float(input("Enter your first number:"))

# Ask the user to enter the second number, converts the input from a
# string to a float number, and assigns it to the variable num2
        num2 = float(input("Enter your second number:"))

# Perform the chosen operation based on user's choice

# Call the addition function and print the sum of num1 and num2
        if choice == "1":
            print(f"The result is: {addition(num1, num2)}")

## Call the subtraction function and print the difference of num1 and num2
        if choice == "2":
            print(f"The result is: {subtraction(num1, num2)}")

# Call the multiplication function and print the product of num1 and num2
        if choice == "3":
            print(f"The result is: {multiplication(num1, num2)}")

# Call the division function and print the quotient of num1 and num2
        if choice == "4":
            print(f"The result is: {division(num1, num2)}")

# This construct ensures that certain code is only executed when the script is run
# directly, and not when it is imported as a module in another script.
